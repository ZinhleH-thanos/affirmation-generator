## 👩🏽‍💻 Why I Built This

This project is part of my journey toward becoming an **AI Engineer**. I started learning Python on my own and then attended the **WeThinkCode Bootcamp** from **May 5–10, 2025**, where I improved my Python skills by solving logic problems, building small programs, and working with others.

This affirmation generator is a small but meaningful project that brings together:
- Python functions  
- Lists and random selection  
- Input/output  
- A touch of creativity and personality!
